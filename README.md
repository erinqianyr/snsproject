We created a webserver using node.js and mySQL and an ios application using swift4.

On the ios side, a users can send or receive mass massages based on location, category and time.
They can also search for those messages based on location, category, time, and status of the message.

The webserver manages the database updating the tables based on the new information from the application, 
sending information from the database to the application, and archiving and timing out messages and users.
